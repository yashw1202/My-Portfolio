            <p>
              I'm a Web Developer with a passion for building functional,
              scalable, and user-friendly solutions. My expertise covers Web
              Development, Python, SQL, Data Analytics, and Power BI, giving me
              the ability to approach projects with both creativity and problem
              solving. I enjoy combining front-end design with backend logic and
              data to create solutions that are practical, reliable, and
              impactful. In Web Development, I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
              and frameworks to create responsive and modern websites. My focus
              is on delivering clean interfaces, smooth performance, and an
              engaging user experience. Alongside this, I have strong skills in
              Python, where I work on backend development, automation, and
              problem solving. One of my key strengths is OpenCV, which I use
              for computer vision, object detection, and image processing
              projects. This allows me to merge software with real-world
              applications, making my work innovative and useful. I also bring
              in SQL expertise, ensuring that databases are well structured,
              optimized, and capable of handling data flows efficiently to
              support web and analytics solutions. Beyond development, I am
              skilled in Data Analytics and Power BI, which I use to extract
              insights and present them in meaningful ways. With data analytics,
              I enjoy exploring datasets to identify trends and patterns that
              help drive smarter decision making. Using Power BI, I create
              interactive dashboards and clear visualizations that turn complex
              data into easy-to-understand stories for stakeholders. Together,
              these skills allow me to bridge web technologies with data-driven
              solutions. Outside of technology, I am passionate about music and
              playing guitar, which keeps me creative and balanced. I am always
              eager to learn new tools, take on challenges, and collaborate on
              projects that make a real-world impact while helping me grow as a
              professional.
